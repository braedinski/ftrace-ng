ftrace-ng

The 'next-generation' of Ryan O'Neill's `ftrace`, which apparently needs updating.

`ftrace-ng` will use `libelfmaster`, and will (hopefully) be easier to read and maintain.
I can't make any promises as to whether it will be better than the current `ftrace`, but I hope.

To compile, you'll need to use `libelfmaster`.
